* XMLBACK

 "XML Animated Background Creator" is a Nautilus script to easily generate XML wallpaper slideshows (wallpapers that change automatically) for GNOME 3.
 [taken from here](http://www.webupd8.org/2011/12/create-wallpaper-slideshow-with-xml.html). A nice usage is made of : 
 * installation of a localized nautilus script
 * gtk dialogs from the command line with [zenity](https://help.gnome.org/users/zenity/stable/)
 * localization done with TEXTDOMAIN/gettext and .mo files (GNU message catalog)

# in case program crashes before even passing the main() function, probably
there is library loading problem, in that case, set those variable before
running the executable:

```bash
LD_DEBUG=all LD_DEBUG_OUTPUT=log.txt ./prog
```

Once the offending library has been found, manually preload it with:

```bash
LD_PRELOAD=/lib64/libpthread.so.0 ./prog
```
